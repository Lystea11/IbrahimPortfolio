## 🚀 Overview

  

Welcome to **Ibrahim's Portfolio** — a personal portfolio website created for a client who wanted a colorful and simple presentation. The main feature of this website is its dynamic background, created using a physics canvas powered by **Matter.js**. This project uses static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an ease-of-use for my client.

  

## 💡 Inspiration

  

The inspiration for this project comes from various websites I've encountered that integrate physics-based animations and interactions. By incorporating **Matter.js** into the design, I was able to refine my skills in math, while also creating a visually impressive portfolio for my client.

  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

  

This project utilizes a minimalistic technology stack for simplicity and performance:

  

-  **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (with FontAwesome for icons)

-  **JS Libraries:** Lenis, Matter.js, Headroom.js, GSAP Scroll Trigger

-  **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

-  **Version Control:** GitHub

  

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

  

The primary goal of this project was to balance visual appeal with simplicity. By using **GSAP** to create smooth, scroll-based animations, I aimed to make the site feel interactive and dynamic, without compromising its core purpose as a personal portfolio. Functionality was kept in mind during development to maintain an efficient user experience.

  

## 🔍 Key Features

  

-  **Physics-Based Canvas Background (Matter.js)**

-  **Colorful, Simple Design**

-  **Responsive/Dynamic Layout**

  

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

  

This project has been finalized and there are no further updates planned. It serves its purpose well and I consider it complete.
